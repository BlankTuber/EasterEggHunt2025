            <p class="narrative">Wisdom often lies not in direct answers, but in deciphering the path revealed through words. Contemplate the riddle below.</p>
            
            <p class="instruction-heading">The Riddle:</p>
            <blockquote class="riddle">
                I have a face but cannot smile,<br>
                I have hands but cannot clap.<br>
                I tell you something all the while,<br>
                But cannot speak a single scrap.
                <br><br>
                <em>Seek me where time is often kept, <br>
                   perhaps upon a wall I've crept.</em>
            </blockquote>
