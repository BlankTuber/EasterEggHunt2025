# Challenge Implementations

## Individual Challenges (Prioritized)

### Level 1 Challenges (Simple Web-Based Games)
These are quick to implement with JavaScript/HTML5 and should be prioritized first:

#### Navigator Challenges
1. **Pong Game**
   - HTML5 Canvas implementation with basic physics
   - Difficulty increases over time (ball speed)
   - Auto-save progress via AJAX to central API

2. **Math Sequence Puzzle**
   - Form-based challenge with number sequence completion
   - Input validation for correct mathematical patterns
   - Hint system after failed attempts

#### Sage Challenges
1. **Crossword Puzzle**
   - Grid-based implementation with clue display
   - Client-side validation for letter correctness
   - Use a crossword JSON generator library for easy creation

2. **Shift Cipher Puzzle**
   - Text input with encoded message
   - Decoding mechanism with Caesar cipher algorithm
   - Progressive hints if stuck

#### Chronicler Challenges
1. **Emoji Decoder**
   - Display sequence of emojis to interpret
   - Multiple choice or text input for solutions
   - Visual feedback on correct/incorrect answers

2. **Trend Timeline**
   - Drag-and-drop interface for ordering cultural trends
   - Visual feedback when items are placed in correct order
   - Timeline visualization after completion

#### Craftsman Challenges
1. **Football Team Guesser**
   - Shadow emblems displayed as images
   - Text input for team names with auto-completion
   - Progress tracking with unlocks for correct answers

2. **Morse Code Puzzle**
   - Visual or audio presentation of Morse code
   - On-screen decoder key as a reference
   - Text input field for translation

#### Apprentice Challenges
1. **Video Game Character Identifier**
   - Silhouette images of game characters
   - Multiple choice or text input for character names
   - Animated reveal when correctly identified

2. **Video Game Timeline**
   - Drag-and-drop interface for game screenshots/thumbnails
   - Position validation against correct historical order
   - Info cards about each game upon completion

### Level 2 Challenges (More Complex Interactions)
Implement these after completing Level 1 challenges:

#### All Roles
1. **Memory Card Games / Sliding Puzzles**
   - Grid-based card flipping with match detection
   - Image scrambling with move counter
   - Timer for competitive element

2. **Word Puzzles** (Word Search, Scramble, Hangman, Word Ladder)
   - Canvas or div-based word grids
   - Letter selection/highlighting mechanics
   - Visual feedback systems

3. **Color-Based Challenges** (Sequences, Mixer)
   - Canvas-based color presentation
   - Input via color picker or preselected palette
   - Validation against target colors/sequences

## Convergence Challenges

### Pair Challenges
Implement these mid-project once individual challenges are working:

1. **Navigator + Craftsman: Geocaching**
   - Navigator UI shows coordinates
   - Craftsman UI shows location descriptions
   - Both players must input combined solution
   - WebSocket communication to verify both sides have contributed

2. **Craftsman + Apprentice: Cross Device Puzzle**
   - Split puzzle interface with each player seeing half
   - Drag-and-drop pieces that affect both screens
   - Real-time updates via WebSockets
   - Success only when both sides complete correctly

### Trivia Group Challenges
Build a reusable trivia engine that can be adapted for different groups:

1. **Trivia System**
   - JSON-based question bank with categories and difficulty levels
   - Question distribution system for different player roles
   - WebSocket-based answer submission and validation
   - Group progress tracking

2. **Group Configurations**
   - Group A (Sage + Chronicler + Apprentice): Common knowledge questions
   - Group B (Sage + Chronicler + Apprentice): Niche/specialized questions
   - Group C (Navigator + Craftsman): Tech-related questions

### All-Player Convergence
These are the most complex and should be scheduled later in the project:

1. **Cross Device Puzzle (Sequence)**
   - Five interconnected interfaces showing puzzle pieces
   - Movement restrictions requiring coordination
   - WebSocket synchronization of all player actions
   - Visual feedback showing other players' actions

2. **Digital Escape Room**
   - Web-based "room" with interactive elements
   - Role-specific puzzles that unlock sections for others
   - Central progress tracking visible to all players
   - Consider using a simple 2D canvas rather than 3D Roblox for time constraints

3. **Combine Codes (Final Challenge)**
   - Unique interface elements for each player role
   - Code combination mechanism with visual feedback
   - Real-time validation as players input their parts
   - Dramatic reveal animation when complete

## External System Integrations

1. **Roblox Integration**
   - Use Roblox API to launch custom games
   - Webhook callbacks when objectives completed
   - Fallback web version if Roblox integration is too time-consuming

2. **Physical Hunt Component**
   - Generate printable clue cards with QR codes
   - QR codes redirect to web confirmation pages
   - Final physical egg contains unique code to enter in system
