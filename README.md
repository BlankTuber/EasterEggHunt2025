[Technical Considerations](https://github.com/BlankTuber/EasterEggHunt2025/blob/main/technical-considerations.md)


## Core Architecture (Focus Week 1)

1. **Central Progress System**
   - PHP REST API to track player progress, unlock challenges, and maintain game state
   - Simple MySQL database with tables for players, team composition, unlocked challenges, and completion status
   - Session management using tokens rather than traditional login

2. **Realtime Communication Hub**
   - WebSocket server on your Proxmox machine for multiplayer aspects
   - Broadcast channel for all players
   - Team-specific channels for convergence challenges
   - Simple authentication using the token from the main system

## Key Implementation Strategies

Based on your story and requirements, I've organized the plan around these key strategies:

1. **Challenge Independence**: Each challenge is designed as a self-contained module, making it easier to develop and test in parallel without dependencies on other components.

2. **Progressive Development**: Start with simple challenges first, then advance to more complex ones, ensuring you always have working elements if time runs short.

3. **Flexible Multiplayer**: The WebSocket server handles all real-time communication but degrades gracefully if connection issues occur.

4. **Streamlined User Experience**: Auto-saves progress, minimizes manual logins, and keeps navigation intuitive.

5. **Narrative Integration**: Thread the story throughout the experience while keeping technical implementation straightforward.

## What to Focus On When

Please check the attached artifacts for detailed breakdowns of:

1. **Challenge Implementation Details**: Specific technical approaches for each challenge type
2. **4-Week Implementation Timeline**: Day-by-day task priorities
3. **Technical Considerations & Priority Focus**: Decision points and fallback strategies

## Most Important Focus Points

If you're looking for the absolute priorities to focus on:

1. **Week 1**: Build the core progress system and 1-2 simple challenges for each role
2. **Week 2**: Implement WebSocket communication and first convergence challenges
3. **Week 3**: Develop more complex individual challenges and pair-based convergence
4. **Week 4**: Build the final all-player challenges and polish the experience
