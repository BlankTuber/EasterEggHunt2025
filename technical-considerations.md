# Technical Considerations & Priority Focus

## Key Technical Decisions

### Frontend Development
- **Vanilla JS Approach**: Given the 4-week timeline, focus on vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS rather than frameworks
- **Canvas vs. DOM**: Use HTML5 Canvas for games (Pong, Sliding Puzzles), DOM manipulation for simpler puzzles (Crosswords, Word Games)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build mobile-friendly but optimize for desktop/tablet where multiplayer is more practical
- **Asset Loading**: Create a simple preloader system to avoid delays during gameplay
- **State Management**: Use browser localStorage for individual challenges, server-side state for multiplayer

### Backend Development
- **PHP API**: Simple RESTful endpoints for:
  - Player registration and session management
  - Challenge unlocking and progress tracking
  - Team formation and role assignment
  - Result submission and validation
- **Database Design**: Keep it minimal
  - Players table (ID, name, role, team, token)
  - Challenges table (ID, type, requirements, completion criteria)
  - Progress table (player ID, challenge ID, status, completion timestamp)
  - Teams table (team ID, members, active convergence challenges)

### WebSocket Implementation
- **Node.js Server**: Run on your Proxmox server
- **Socket.IO**: For easy fallback to long polling if WebSocket fails
- **Message Structure**: Standardize on:
  - Challenge updates (player actions, state changes)
  - System messages (unlocks, completions)
  - Chat functionality (optional)
- **Reconnection Handling**: Important for maintaining game state during connection issues

## Priority Focus Areas (Ordered by Importance)

1. **Core Progress System**
   - This is the backbone that everything else depends on
   - Implement early and thoroughly test before adding challenges
   - Ensure it can handle asynchronous updates from multiple challenges

2. **Individual Challenges - First Batch**
   - Start with 1-2 challenges per role that are straightforward to implement
   - Focus on games with established libraries/patterns (Pong, Crossword)
   - Test thoroughly before moving to more complex challenges

3. **WebSocket Communication Layer**
   - Essential for all multiplayer aspects
   - Implement early with simple test cases before actual convergence challenges
   - Stress test with simulated multiple connections

4. **Basic Convergence Mechanics**
   - Start with simpler two-player convergence challenges
   - Use these to validate the WebSocket infrastructure
   - Begin with trivia as it's straightforward to implement

5. **Narrative Integration & UI Flow**
   - Create a cohesive experience between the independent components
   - Implement consistent styling and transitions
   - Ensure clear instructions and progress indicators

6. **Advanced Individual Challenges**
   - More complex mechanics like color mixing, sliding puzzles
   - These can be developed in parallel by different team members if available

7. **Complex Convergence Challenges**
   - Final challenges requiring all players
   - These depend on all previous systems working correctly
   - Schedule adequate testing time as these are most prone to issues

8. **Physical Component Integration**
   - QR code generation and validation
   - Instructions for physical hunt component
   - This can be developed last as it's the final step

## Areas That Can Be Simplified If Time Runs Short

1. **Roblox Integration**
   - Consider a simple 2D web alternative if Roblox integration is too complex
   - Could still maintain the escape room concept in a simpler format

2. **Challenge Complexity**
   - Prepare simplified versions of complex challenges
   - Have fallback options ready for challenges that prove difficult to implement

3. **Visual Polish**
   - Focus on functionality first, polish afterward
   - Prepare basic CSS that can be enhanced if time permits

4. **Narrative Elements**
   - Core story elements can be abbreviated if needed
   - Prioritize gameplay mechanics over story elaboration

5. **Analytics and Detailed Progress Tracking**
   - Focus on essential progress tracking first
   - Add detailed analytics only if time permits
